This code produces a submission scoring 5th on the TFI Kaggle Competition leaderboard.

It is a very slightly modified version of the code that produced our official best-scoring 13th place submission (team Firefly).

About the Data: The provided training set is only 137 rows long! Each row describes a restaurant in Turkey operated by TFI foods, the competition sponsor. Most of the features are anonymized and labeled P1 through P38, they appear to be categorical. There are a handful of better described columns, such as opening date, restaurant type and city. The test set officially has 100,000 rows, but in reality most of it was artifically generated by Kaggle and not scored. We and other competitors determined that the real test set had just 321 rows.
The goal ws to predict restaurant revenues. The scoring metric is RMSE (root mean squared error), which is very sensitive to outliers, especially on such a small trainng set. So the general strategy of this code is to use only the simplest and soundest preprocessing and modeling techniques (and avoid overfitting).
