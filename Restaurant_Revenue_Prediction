##About the Data:
The provided training set is only 137 rows long! Each row describes a restaurant in Turkey operated by TFI foods, the competition
sponsor. Most of the features are anonymized and labeled P1 through P38, they appear to be categorical. There are a handful of better 
described columns, such as opening date, restaurant type and city. The test set officially has 100,000 rows, but in reality most 
of it was artifically generated by Kaggle and not scored. We and other competitors determined that the real test set had just 321 rows.

The goal ws to predict restaurant revenues. The scoring metric is RMSE (root mean squared error), which is very sensitive to 
outliers, especially on such a small trainng set. So the general strategy of this code is to use only the simplest and soundest 
preprocessing and modeling techniques (and avoid overfitting).
